# Boosk

A basic e-commerce platform designed for educational purposes, featuring a Front-End developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complemented by a Back-End implemented in PHP and MYSQL. Basically i'm experimenting with a few stuff (REACT, SCRAPING etc..).

# STUFF TODO:
use MYSQL for database (dummy data)
Modern UI (MAYBE 3D)
